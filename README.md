# FishSorter-IoT-Based-Fish-Classification-Using-CNN
This project implements an IoT system for sorting fish based on their species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system leverages MQTT protocol for communication between ESP32 and ESP-CAM, and a Flask API to load and serve the pre-trained CNN model in .h5 format.
